# Boston-housing model selection and regularization

Here we are finding the best model to predict the values of housing in Boston
using these following methods: 
1. best subset selection
2. forward stepwise selection
3. backward stepwise selection
4. ridge regression fit
7. partial least squares analysis

Note: lasso and ridge fit regression are less flexible than linear regression
and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias
is less than its decrease in variance.
